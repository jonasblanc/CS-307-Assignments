# CS-307-Assignments

This repository contains the four labs done in EPFL course: CS-307 "Introduction to multiprocessor architecture". We used SCITAS cluster to run tasks in parallel. The execute.sh scripts are used to run the executables on the cluster.

* [98/100] Lab1 is an introduction to parallel programming in OpenMp. In this lab we approximate PI and compute basic numerical integration.
* [89/100] Lab2 focus on sowtware optimisation in OpenMp. In this lab we speed up parallel heat map transfer computation.
* [95/100] Lab3 is about memory access and instruction re-ordering.
* [99/100] Lab4 is the same problem than in lab2 but this time on a GPU using CUDA.
